// To authorize someone to withdraw funds from smart contract after a specific time... This logic can be used.
// First we will declare a variable like this

uint creationTime = block.timestamp;

// Now make a require function or a modofier like this..

require( block.timestamp > creationTime + 1 minutes);  // any time duration can be used like 10 minute, 1 hour, 5 days, etc.

// If you want to restrict a user to withdraw their funds from smart contract till some specific duration. then this logic can be used.
// First we will declare a variable like this...

uint tillThisTime = block.timestamp + 30 days;  // here you can put any value of time like 2 days, 1 month etc.

// Now make a modifier or require function like this...

require(block.timestamp < tillThisTime);
