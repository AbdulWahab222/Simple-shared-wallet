# Simple-shared-wallet
With the help of this Simple shared wallet contract you can store Ethers which can be accessed and managed by not only you (the contract owner) but also several other admin accounts which are authorized by the owner.

The contract owner can assign a specific amount of Ether for every account and all those authorized accounts will use their allocated funds as and when they need it.

Time Lock functionality logic can also be added in this smart wallet.
