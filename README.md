# Simple-shared-wallet
With the help of this Simple shared wallet contract you can store Ethers which can be accessed and managed by not only you (the contract owner) but also several other admin accounts.
The contract owner can assign a specific amount for every account and all those accounts will use their allocated funds as and when they need it.
